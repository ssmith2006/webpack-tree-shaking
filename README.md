# webpack-tree-shaking

##Tree Shaking- When I switch between production mode and development mode, I notice that the production mode has only one line (or less) code and development mode has so many lines that you have to search to find your content.

##Load Behavior-I used the css loader. It allowed me to inject CSS into the DOM. I created a styles subfolder in the src folder.  In the styles folder, I created a styles sheet with simple background color for the body and imported it into my entry file, index.js.  I confirmed it worked when I viewed the browser.
